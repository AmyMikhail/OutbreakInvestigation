## Overview

This
[repository](https://github.com/EPIET/OutbreakInvestigation/tree/master/Mapping)
hosts the R learning materials for the EPIET Outbreak Investigation
module (OIM).

In particular, you will find the R materials for:

-   School dinner foodborne outbreak case study (Copenhagen, Denmark)
-   Unpasteurised milk geospatial analysis and mapping case study (UK)

Credits go to the original authors of the case studies, as well as the
contributors who subsequently adapted the R companion guides (see
version history in the guides for a full list of authors and
contributors). The guides are reviewed and updated annually.

These case studies are covered by a Gnu General Public Licence version 3
(GPL-3). Please read the [licence
conditions](https://github.com/EPIET/OutbreakInvestigation/blob/master/LICENSE)
before using or distributing this case study. Additional details on
distrubution are also included in the case study guides.

### Note on R guides:

The guide is also available as a HTML and .pdf file in the `guide`

use the HTML version of this guide (either online or off-line) as it is
easier to navigate between the sections, however if you prefer, you can
also print out the .pdf version.

### Comments and suggestions:

Comments and suggestions are welcome. If you have found a bug in the
case study code, please raise an issue about it
[here](https://github.com/EPIET/OutbreakInvestigation/issues), clearly
stating the nature of the problem and providing a reproducible example.
You can also use the **issues** page to suggest new features or topics
to cover in a future version.
