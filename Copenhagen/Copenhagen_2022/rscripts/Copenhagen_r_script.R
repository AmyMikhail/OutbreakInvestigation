    case = case_when(
      
      # Cases have any gastro symptoms with onset after the meal:

        gastrosymptoms == TRUE & 
        !is.na(onset_datetime) & 
        (onset_datetime >= meal_datetime)

      meal == TRUE & 
        (gastrosymptoms == FALSE | 
           # ... or have gastro symptoms but onset is before the meal:
           (gastrosymptoms == TRUE & (onset_datetime < meal_datetime)))

  )


# First check how many people ate a meal at the dinner party:
atemeal <- linelist %>%

    TRUE ~ case
    
  )
  )


# Retabulate cases to see if anything has changed:
janitor::tabyl(dat = linelist, case)

# Cross-tabulate onset date time with case status:
janitor::tabyl(dat = linelist, onset_datetime, case) %>% 
  adorn_totals()


# Subset and open the records in the viewer:

linelist <- linelist %>%

  # Remove rows where case is NA:
  drop_na(case)

# Export clean linelist:

# Descriptive analysis ----------------------------------------------------



# Descriptive analysis {.tabset .tabset-pills}

## Introduction

### Recap

In part 1 of the *Copenhagen* case study, you: 

   + imported the outbreak linelist
   + cleaned the data
   + reformatted variables
   + checked for plausibility and errors
   + defined new variables
   + exported the clean data to a new Microsoft Excel file
   + created some exploratory tables, counts and histograms


It may be useful to reflect on what you have done so far.  Specifically:

   + Was there anything you struggled with and could not find a solution for? 
   + Which `R` concepts where new to you?


### Goals

In this session, we will perform some descriptive analysis.  Typically, we would describe the outbreak in terms of time, place and person.  In this data set, we don't have geospatial information, but we do have time (onset dates and times, incubation periods) and person (age, sex, clinical symptoms).  You will:
  
  + Describe cases by age and sex (create an age sex pyramid)
+ Describe case symptoms
+ Describe and illustrate incubation periods
+ Create an epidemic curve
+ Calculate attack proportions
+ summarise the analysis so far and generate hypotheses:
  + Any surprising findings regarding cohort characteristics?
  + Does the shape of the epicurve support a viral or toxic aetiology?
  + What other information can you obtain from the epicurve?
  + Does the summary of symptoms help you narrow down the suspect agent?
  + Do you have any hypothesis about the vehicle of infection so far?
  
  
  ### R prep
  
  In this section, we will begin to build a picture of the characteristics of this outbreak by performing some descriptive analysis.

If you closed RStudio after the last section, remember that when you restart or reopen RStudio, you will need to:
  
  + Open RStudio via the R project file in the case study materials folder
+ Open your R script or R markdown document from the files pane in RStudio
+ Load the required packages (run this chunk: \@ref(load-pkgs))
+ Rerun the code to clean the data set, or:
  + Import the cleaned data set that you saved at the end of the last session.


For convenience, we will start by importing the cleaned data set:
  
  ```{r import_clean_data}

# Import the cleaned data set using rio and here packages:
linelist <- rio::import(here::here("data", "Copenhagen_clean.xlsx")) %>% 
  
  # Convert character columns to factors:
  mutate(across(.cols = where(is.character), 
                .fns = as.factor))

```


Many of the descriptive features can be illustrated graphically, for which we will use the package `ggplot2`.

We will also create summary tables, using `janitor::tabyl()` for further exploration and the `gtsummary` package to create nicely formatted tables that can be used in reports and other publications.

For more detail on `tabyl()` function and the `adorn_XYZ`-helpers, see the [`janitor`-documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/tabyls.html) or [*The Epidemiologist R Handbook* section on tabulation](https://epirhandbook.com/en/descriptive-tables.html#tbl_janitor).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       To create some of the summary tables, we will need to describe and calculate summary statistics for multiple columns in the same way.  There are special functions in `tidyverse` packages that make it easier to *iterate* over multiple columns and apply the same calculations to them, without having to repeat the code for each one.  We already saw how this worked with `across()`, `if_any()` and `if_all()`in the previous section.  The `purrr` package, which is part of the tidyverse, has several `map()` functions that extend this capability to more complex use cases.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       However, in this case study, we will mainly take advantage of the convenience functions in the `gtsummary` package, which has relatively simple syntax to create common summary statistics.  Most of these functions can take a list of columns as input and will iterate over them to create the table.  The default settings of `gtsummary` tables are in most cases already adequate for publication, but the individual features can also be customised.  You can find further information in the [Epidemiologist R handbook section on gtsummary](https://www.epirhandbook.com/en/descriptive-tables.html#tbl_gt).

However, during outbreak investigations, you may need to deploy questionnaires as soon as possible and before a plan has been developed. In these cases, your experience will be an important resource to fall back on.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         This might be a bit easier to assess if we look at the symptoms in an ordered bar chart.  To do this, we will need to reshape the data, so that one column contains symptoms and another column contains the proportion of respondents with a given symptom in each case.  We will use `pivot_longer()` to reshape the data, then `group_by()`, `summarise()` and `count()` to tally up the counts for each symptom, stratified by case definition.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       We can then create the bar plot with `ggplot()`.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Finally, when specifying the aesthetics, we can reorder the symptom bars on the x axis by count in descending order.  This will also help to make the plot more legible and easier to interpret.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Note that this type of figure is best flipped on its side (which we do with `ggplot2::coord_flip()`), as this makes the axis labels easier to read and the bars easier to compare.  Even though the axes are flipped, we still need to refer to symptoms as the x axis and count as the y axis.

Commonly, *attack proportions* are also called "*attack rates*" but please note that "*attack rate*" is a misnomer and should not be used: "*attack rates*" are not *rates*, but rather *proportions*. Mathematically, a *rate* is defined as a change in one unit per change in another unit. For example, think about velocity: the distance traveled per time passed, typically measured in *meters*/*seconds*. Other examples include decay of radioactive material with *decays*/*seconds*, or widely used in epidemiology: *incidence rate* - the number of new cases per month/year/etc. Crucially, *rates* have no upper limit: 10, 100, 1000 individuals can fall sick per month. *Proportions*, in contrast, compare the amount of something to the amount of the whole. *Attack proportions* compare the number of those having become sick to the size of the whole sample. As such, *attack proportions* can never be greater than 1 or 100% - at maximum, the entire sample became ill.

We can then use `filter()`, `select()` and `pull()` to extract the attack proportion of cases.

To increase resolution, we could enhance the time information to include both day and hour.

Here, `fill`  adds an additional variable to be displayed in the plot: `group` is going to determine the fill-colour of our bars. `facet_wrap` splits the graph in two: one each for the two levels of `sex`.

The packages `broom` and `broom.mixed` (for mixed models) are designed to convert model outputs to a 'tidy' table of results.  The output tables typically include the coefficients (exponentiated if you choose that option) and their 95% confidence intervals, as well as *P* values.  The `gtsummary` package that we have already been using to look at counts and attack proportions also uses `broom` to tabulate model results.

In practice, this means the confidence intervals are more likely to cross 1 and fewer of them will have a significant *P* value.  This is why the error variance needs to be calculated with robust methods instead.

Of these, each has different advantages and disadvantages.

However, a particular difficulty with this function is that it requires cross-tabulated data in a 2 by 2 table (as the name implies) and the values have to be presented in a specific order.  Creating the 2 by 2 table is an extra step that is more difficult to iterate through for multiple exposures.  In addition, if the input table cells are presented in the wrong order, this can lead to difficulties with interpretation.

The results are exported to a publication-ready table with little effort.  However, it is currently not possible to apply robust error variance with this function.

The results are presented in a simple table (`data.frame`).  This function is very easy to use, but the output requires a little extra formatting before it can be transformed to a publishable table for reports.

We will calculate odds ratios by specifying the model method as `glm`, the family as `binomial` and link as `logit`.

However, this format is not suitable for directly including in a report, and the column names are abbreviated, which makes them hard to interpret. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       In the code chunk below, we first extract the data.frame containing the tabular output. Column names are cleaned with `janitor::clean_names()` and  the row names are added to the table as the first column.  We use the `tidyr::unite()` function to bind the lower and upper confidence intervals together in a single column, as this makes them easier to read.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       We then convert the output to a publication ready table, using the package `flextable`.  Similar to a `ggplot` graph, flextables are built in layers and the functions in the package give very fine control over all of the features. In this code we have made adjustments to the text alignment of the columns and headers, made the header rows bold and italic, added some vertical borders between the sub-sections of the table and gave the columns some easy to interpret labels.  We also highlighted rows with a *p* value of less than 0.05 in yellow.

Before performing any statistical test in R, you will need to know the kind of data it accepts and what format the data should be in.  It is also useful to know if there are default settings for the function's arguments, and determine whether these default values will suit your objective or not.

For now, type `?chisq.test()` into your RStudio console to bring up the help page and find out more about the function. Alternatively, you can type `chisq.test` in the search bar of the help tab.

[Chapter 18 of the Epidemiologist R handbook](https://epirhandbook.com/en/simple-statistical-tests.html) describes three different options to perform simple statistical tests; base R, with the `rstatix` package and with `gtsummary`, as we have already seen.  In the code below, as our main objective is exploratory, we will use a mix of base R and `janitor::tabyl`.

However, you may wish to investigate potential associations individually, before deciding what to include in a summary table.

Note that `chisq.test()` expects a 2x2 matrix (numeric table) as input.

During the data cleaning session, we converted `class` to a factor; conveniently factor levels are also represented by numbers, so we can treat `class` as a numeric variable by applying the function `as.numeric()`.

Is there a difference between age in males and females?** 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Age is a numeric variable; therefore we could perform a student's t-test if the data are normally distributed.  If they are not, we can again return to the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

You may already remember that this outbreak has a heavily skewed age distribution, because most of the people affected were teenage students.

We can check first of all if age in general is normally distributed or not:

```{r age_norm_test}

# Check if age overall follows a normal distribution:
shapiro.test(linelist$age)

```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

As you may have suspected, age overall is not normally distributed, due to the large number of teenagers and small number of older adult (teachers) in the affected population.

But what about the age distribution among students?

```{r age_norm_test_students}

# Check if age of students follows a normal distribution:
linelist %>% 
  
  filter(group == "student") %>% 
  
  select(age) %>% 
  
  pull() %>% 
  
  shapiro.test()

```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Note that `shapiro.test()` expects a numeric variable as input; here we have used `filter()`, `select()` and `pull()` to pass a variable of the correct format to the test.

Unfortunately, the results show that age still deviates significantly from a normal distribution, even among students.  


*Note:*

You may have noticed that low *P* values are being presented in scientific notation, which can be hard to read.  You can switch this feature off in your R session by typing `options(scipen = 999)` in your RStudio console or at the top of your R script.


Next we will perform a Wilcoxon rank sum test to look at age distribution by sex.  Remember that the first argument must be numeric:

```{r agesex_wilcox_test}

# Perform Wilcoxon rank sum test on age and sex:
wilcox.test(age ~ sex, data = linelist)


```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;


**Questions to consider:**

  1. What do the results tell you - is there an association between age and sex?  

  2. If yes, what is it?

## Dose response

In this section, we will look at the dose response variables, which indicate for each food or drink item how many portions or glasses each respondent consumed.  This may give us a better idea of whether there is a dose response effect with any of the suspected vehicles, and if so, which one(s) have the strongest effect.  

Dose-response analysis can be particularly useful to tease apart potential vehicles in a foodborne outbreak when there has been cross-contamination.  Typically, the main contaminant will have a stronger dose-response effect.

Let's have a look first at our top contenders (hint: it is veal and pasta!).  We can use the Wilcoxon rank sum test again:

In this case, `.x` is used as the wild card in the formula (standing in for variable names) and we have pasted the formula together for `wilcox.test()` (remember it takes the format `numeric ~ response variable`).

The output has stored multiple data.frames as a list of objects; you can access a data.frame within the list by typing the name that you gave the output (in this case `vealstrata`) followed by a dollar sign and the name of the data.frame you are interested in: thus `vealstrata$df2` will print the second data.frame.

For a variable to be a confounder it needs to be associated both with the outcome (being a case) and with the exposure. We know from univariable analysis that pasta is associated with being a case; we can now check if it is also associated with veal.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The distribution of the cohort regarding sex, group and class also didn't reveal anything unusual. Students seem a bit more affected by the outbreak than teachers and the attack rate is higher for older students in higher classes. This, however, is a purely descriptive result.

When constructing an epicurve, we need to decide on the resolution, i.e. the time interval for a single bar. A rule of thumb is to use one third or one fourth of the average incubation period as an interval. For our investigation this means we should use approximately a 6h interval.

This seems a good choice, as we saw that the daily interval was too coarse to really see the signal we're after. The epicurve and the summary of the incubation period show that there seemed to be a rapid onset of symptoms following exposure. This is in line with our previous suspicion that a virus or a toxin might be the causative agent in the outbreak.

Also people that only consumed a little contaminated food and therefore only a low infectious dose could have a longer incubation period and could explain the late cases.

There are too few people that experienced vomiting!

In particular, the dose response relationship that was found for pasta points towards pasta as the potential vehicle. Pasta as such is unlikely to be contaminated, but as you can see in the label, it was served with pesto!

Maybe pasta was clean but eaten by all the people who ate the food item that actually was contaminated!
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ### Stratified analyses
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         We found that pasta consumption confounds the association between eating veal and being ill. The crude (univariable) result for veal suggests that veal is a risk factor (crude RR = 1.73, CI: 1.12 - 2.67), but when we adjust for the consumption of pasta we see that actually this result is due to the fact that most people who ate veal also ate pasta.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Within the stratum of the people who ate pasta, veal has no effect (RR = 1.20, CI: 0.60 - 2.41). The same holds within the stratum of people who didn't eat pasta (RR = 0.99, CI = 0.34, 2.91). This is why the adjusted MH-RR also suggests that veal has no effect (RRadj = 1.12, CI: 0.62 - 2.02).

This result taken together with the dose response relationship we found earlier for pasta gives additional evidence that there was something going on with the pesto!


### Conclusions of the investigation

In summary, it is fair to say that there was both epidemiological and microbiological evidence that the pasta salad with pesto was the most likely vehicle of transmission in this outbreak. Further investigations focused on how the pasta salad with pesto could have become contaminated and on lessons learned from this outbreak that could then be communicated both to the scientific community, the caterer and the general public.
