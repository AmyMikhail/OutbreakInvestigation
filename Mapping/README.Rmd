## Overview

This [repository](https://github.com/EPIET/OutbreakInvestigation/tree/master/Mapping) hosts the R learning materials for the EPIET Outbreak Investigation module (OIM).  

In particular, you will find the R materials for:

   + School dinner foodborne outbreak case study (Copenhagen, Denmark) 
   + Unpasteurised milk geospatial analysis and mapping case study (UK)

Credits go to the original authors of the case studies, as well as the contributors who subsequently adapted the R companion guides (see version history in the guides for a full list of authors and contributors).  The guides are reviewed and updated annually.

These case studies are covered by a Gnu General Public Licence version 3 (GPL-3).  Please read the [licence conditions](https://github.com/EPIET/OutbreakInvestigation/blob/master/LICENSE) before using or distributing this case study.  Additional details on distrubution are also included in the case study guides.


### School dinner case study:

To follow the Copenhagen school dinner case study, you will need:

   + [R Copenhagen case study materials](https://github.com/EPIET/OutbreakInvestigation/raw/master/Copenhagen/Copenhagen_R_casestudy.zip) (contains data sets, case study guide and R coding template)
   + [R Copenhagen case study guide ](https://epiet.github.io/OutbreakInvestigation/Copenhagen_R_guide.html) (online version)


### Mapping case study:

To follow the UK mapping case study, you will need:

   + [R mapping cases study materials](https://github.com/EPIET/OutbreakInvestigation/raw/master/Mapping/Mapping_R_casestudy.zip) (contains data sets, case study guide and R coding template)
   + [R mapping case study guide ](https://epiet.github.io/OutbreakInvestigation/Mapping_R_guide.html) (online version)


### Note on R guides:

The guide is also available as a HTML and .pdf file in the `guide` sub-directory of the case study materials pack.  We recommend that you use the HTML version of this guide (either online or off-line) as it is easier to navigate between the sections, however if you prefer, you can also print out the .pdf version.


### Comments and suggestions:

Comments and suggestions are welcome.  If you have found a bug in the case study code, please raise an issue about it [here](https://github.com/EPIET/OutbreakInvestigation/issues), clearly stating the nature of the problem and providing a reproducible example. You can also use the **issues** page to suggest new features or topics to cover in a future version.
