## Overview

This [repository](https://github.com/EPIET/OutbreakInvestigation/tree/master/Mapping) hosts the R learning materials for the EPIET Outbreak Investigation module (OIM).  In particular, you will find the R materials for a geospatial analysis and mapping case study, based on an outbreak associated with contaminated raw (unpasteurised) milk.

Credits go to the original authors of the case study, as well as the contributors who subsequently adapted the R companion guide (see version history in the guide for a full list of authors and contributors).  The guide is reviewed and updated annually.

This case study is covered by a Gnu General Public Licence version 3 (GPL-3).  Please read the [licence conditions](https://github.com/EPIET/OutbreakInvestigation/blob/master/LICENSE) before using or distributing this case study.

To follow this case study, you will need:

   + [R mapping cases study materials](https://github.com/EPIET/OutbreakInvestigation/raw/master/Mapping/Mapping_R_casestudy.zip) (contains data sets, case study guide and R coding template)
   + [R mapping case study guide ](https://epiet.github.io/OutbreakInvestigation/Mapping_R_guide.html) (online version)

The guide is also available as a HTML and .pdf file in the `guide` sub-directory of the case study materials pack.  We recommend that you use the HTML version of this guide (either online or off-line) as it is easier to navigate between the sections, however if you prefer, you can also print out the .pdf version.


Comments and suggestions are welcome.  If you have found a bug in the case study code, please raise an issue about it [here](https://github.com/EPIET/OutbreakInvestigation/issues), clearly stating the nature of the problem and providing a reproducible example. You can also use the **issues** page to suggest new features or topics to cover in a future version.
